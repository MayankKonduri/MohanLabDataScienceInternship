# MohanLab Project

## Overview
This project focuses on data analysis and machine learning techniques applied to biomedical research, specifically in the context of Lupus Nephritis. The goal is to identify relevant biomarkers and contribute to ongoing research efforts aimed at finding a cure for this kidney disease.

## Objectives
- Analyze RNA samples to identify virus trends using KBASE.
- Implement Lasso Regression to optimize biomarker panels based on AUC values.
- Generate ROC curves for comparisons between CRC (Colorectal Cancer) and HC (Healthy Controls) with specific proteins.
- Collaborate with researchers to enhance the understanding of Lupus Nephritis through data-driven approaches.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- Matplotlib (for plotting ROC curves)
- KBASE
