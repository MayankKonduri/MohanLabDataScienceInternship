# MohanLab Project Summary (May 2024 - Present)

> **Important Note:** This is not the entire project, part was done with *Lasso Regression*, and the rest was done on other softwares, such as BayesiaLab and Google Sheets.

## Identification of Biomarkers in Patients with Lupus Nephritis

## Overview
This project focuses on data analysis and machine learning techniques applied to biomedical research, specifically in the context of Lupus Nephritis. The goal is to identify relevant biomarkers and contribute to ongoing research efforts aimed at finding a cure for this kidney disease.

## Objectives
- Implement Lasso Regression to optimize biomarker panels based on AUC values.
- Generate ROC curves for comparisons between CRC (Colorectal Cancer) and HC (Healthy Controls) with specific proteins.
- Collaborate with researchers to enhance the understanding of Lupus Nephritis through data-driven approaches.
